# GURPS-Character-Sheet-Current
This is the version of character sheet I am using in my game. It uses roll templates, however I am in the process of converting to Power Cards.
There are several sheet workers built into the sheet.
Other options are a combat modifier calculator, multiple loadouts, additional DR boxs that currenlty correspond to loadout choice. A rough draft version of a Ritual Path Magic tab.
Separate sense checks, fright checks, and a combined melee / ranged attack box.
A point summary to make it easier for points accounting
Added wildcard skill support.
